1- Generate a new role with Molecule, simply run:
$ molecule init role acme.my_new_role --driver-name docker
You should then see a my_new_role folder in your current directory.

2- Enter to my_new_role and execute molecule create
$ cd my_new_role
$ molecule create

3- view created VM
$ molecule list
check with docker:
$ docker ps

4- Now, letâ€™s add a task to our tasks/main.yml like so:

- name: Molecule Hello World!
  debug:
    msg: Hello, World!

5- We can then tell Molecule to test our role against our instance with:
$ molecule converge

6- If we want to manually inspect the instance afterwards, we can run:
$ molecule login

7- Finally, we can exit the instance and destroy it with:
$ molecule destroy
